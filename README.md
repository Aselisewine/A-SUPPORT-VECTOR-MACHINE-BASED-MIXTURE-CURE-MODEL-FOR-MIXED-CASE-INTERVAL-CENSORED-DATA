A1. The function to find the left and right end points

A2 - A4. The function "mydata()" generates synthetic data to test the performance of our proposed model.

A5. The function "smrank()" is the objective function that the optimization algorithm seeks to minimize and it computes the measure of error, given the current values of the beta coefficients.

A6. The function "smsurv()" estimates the baseline survival function using the Breslow technique.

A5. The function "em.nn()" is the Neural network-based EM algorithm to estimate the model parameters and different quantities of interest.
